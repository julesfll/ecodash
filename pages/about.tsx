        Energy Race aims to gamify the reduction of energy usage on university
        campuses. This project was inspired by the first year Dorm Energy
        Competition, where dorms competed to use the lowest amount of energy
        over a certain time span. However, there was no way to view live updates
        of how dormsâ€™ energy usage compared to each other.

          <Image className="rounded-md" src={DormImage} />
        </div>
        Our solution to this problem was to develop a realtime dashboard for
        university energy competitions. UVA and other universities can use this
        platform in order to gamify the reduction of energy usage across dorms,
        school buildings, etc. Our platform uses the UVA facilities API in order
        to get data relating to energy, heating, and water usage.{" "}
